# To be added -
* Fix Chain attack for multiple characters
* Add a different HUD for the new character
* ~~Burnice (close approximation)~~

# Original Character Idea - 
Perfect timing right click counter. (Like sheath mode using LS in monster hunter or foresight slash)

Special resource that can be built up by doing damage, and can be ranked up by doing hold attack (like seth), and being able to consume one rank of the resource to perform Ex Special attack. Character does not have energy.
As the weapon ranks up, character damage increases too, and Ex-Special damage also increases.

Timestop for hold attack to rank up special resource.

Final implemented character!
This was created before Miyabi released, but drew inspiration from things we've seen at the time of creation.
Mechanics:
* Weapon ramping system - As you attack, you gain charge on the weapon. Once it's full, hold LMB to sheath and charge the blade. Releasing this attack will upgrade the weapon and increase damage dealt
* I frames and dodge frames on BA3 and charged BA
